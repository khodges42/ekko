## Install
Just copy the script to bin.

## Usage
You can either manually create a .ekko file or use `ekko set "rm -rf /etc"` with whatever commands you'd like.

From there, you just run ekko and it'll execute that file. If you're in a git directory, it will be able to run a .ekko file even when deep in the directory tree.
